# The Political Economy of the University

Political economy is concerned with the distribution of resources, the role of the state, the influence of special interest groups, and the stability of institutions (both financial and political). By political economy then we mean something emergent, and not just the sum of political science and economics. Instead political economy is a way of analyzing the world around us through a lens of political power and financial structures.  

The political economy of science typically means applying these concerns to how research is funded, influenced, and used by political actors. Contemporarily, studying the political economy of sciences includes the commercialization of scientific outputs (e.g. pharmaceuticals, patents, start-ups, etc), the professionalization of disciplinary knowledge (e.g. computer science -> software engineering; political science -> public administration), and the impact of geopolitics on the migration of scientists (e.g. the AI brain drain).  

Universities and academic research are clearly within the bounds of both political economy (broadly) and the concerns of a political economics of science. Here are some emerging areas of interest in the political economy of the research university: 
- The decreasing role of the state in funding science, and the increasing role of the state in governing classrooms 
- The corporatization of the university (e.g. named buildings,  sponsored research facilities,  exclusive corporate contracts, chaired professorships, scholarships, etc) 
- Technology transfer offices that attempt to license and spin out university businesses from basic science research
- The increasing size and power of university endowments, and the inequality they exacerbate 
- The inability for research universities to compete with industry for access to specialized equipment and knowledge 
- The contingent workforce of the research university (e.g. research scientists, postdocs, and adjunct instructors) and their labor organizing 

If INSC 501 is a class about history as well as philosophy, then it is worth our understanding of the role the university has played in intellectual development, scientific breakthroughs, culture, and education. 

This could be an entire course. In lieu of 10 weeks we'll constrain our discussion to a few key topics: 
1. Is a research university an oxymoron? In other words- is it possible to do both world-class science and education at the same time? What alternatives exist and do they succeed? 
2. Since at least the 1980's a 'triple helix' model of innovation has been called for - emphasizing the unique contributions of government, industry, and universities to produce public knowledge that is - on the whole - benefitting society.  Are we succeeding, or do we see new tensions arising in this 'complementary' model? If we are not succeeding -what does the future look like with a diminished contribution from research universities?  
3. Given the ideological commitments of a public university - Why do we see so many disputes over labor? The easy answer here is "because capitalism" but that fails to deal with counter-examples from other public institutions.
