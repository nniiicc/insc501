# Research Statement 

In our [myepistemology.com](http://myepistemology.com/) exercise the second set of questions we considered were about the self. These asked
1. How do we come to know ourselves? Is self-knowledge based on introspection, social feedback, or both?
2. Is the self a stable, unchanging entity, or is it constantly evolving and adapting to new experiences?
3. To what extent are our thoughts, beliefs, and actions determined by our environment, genetics, and personal choices?
4. Can we ever have a completely objective understanding of ourselves, or are we always influenced by our subjective perspectives? 

These questions can induce both eyerolling and head scratching. Answering them for ourselves is only one part of the challenge. Once we have a sense of how we feel about these kinds of questoins (as well as our own research beat) we need to figure out how to communicate our answers to our peers. That is, we need to clearly tell each other who we are, what we think, and how we do the work that we do. 

Scientists typically do this through a research statement. The research statement is a common element of a personal website, a job application, and even a conference presentation. A good research statement is declarative - it tells a reader who you are, what you do, and why you do it. There are endless permutations and examples of the research statement, but some common topics that scientists include are as follows: 

## Academic Identity & Positioning

* How does your work fit within your primary field, and what other disciplines or subfields does it connect to? (this might also include previous degrees)
* What unique perspective or approach do you bring to your research area?
* Beyond just your advisor's lab, what academic communities are you becoming part of?

## Research Focus & Contribution

* What is the core problem or phenomenon you study? How would you explain it to someone outside your field?
* Why does this research matter? What real-world impact could it have?
* What gap in knowledge or practice does your work address?

## Methodological Approach

* What combination of methods or tools do you use in your research?
* How does your methodological approach help answer your research questions?
* What technical skills or analytical approaches set your work apart?

## Research Community & Collaboration

* Who are your key collaborators beyond your advisor?
* What roles have you taken on in research projects?
* How do you contribute to your lab or research group's broader mission?

## Early Career Recognition

* What fellowships, grants, or awards support your work?
* Have you engaged with industry, policy, or community partners?
* Where have you presented or published your early findings?

## Scholarly Engagement

* How do you share your research with different audiences?
* What teaching or mentoring experiences connect to your research?
* How do you engage with the broader academic community?

## Research Biography Approaches

### Approach 1: Problem-Centered Narrative

The problem-centered narrative leads with the research problem:

"As a PhD candidate in [field], I study [core problem] by combining approaches from [disciplines]. Working with [advisor/lab], I develop [specific methods/tools] to address [specific gap or challenge]. My dissertation research examines [specific focus], contributing to our understanding of [broader impact]. Through collaborations with [partners/groups], I've had opportunities to [specific achievements/recognition]. Beyond my research, I engage with the community through [teaching/service activities]."

### Approach 2: Methods-to-Impact Structure

The methods-to-impact structure emphasizes methodological innovation:

"My research bridges [disciplines] to tackle [problem area]. Drawing on my background in [relevant experience/skills], I develop [methodological approach] to investigate [specific questions]. As part of the [lab/research group], I lead projects examining [specific focus], which has resulted in [publications/presentations]. I am committed to [broader goals/impact], which I pursue through [specific activities]."

### Approach 3: Impact-to-Methods Structure

The impact-to-methods structure leads with the broader significance and works backward to specific work:

"The rise of [societal challenge/phenomenon] presents questions about [broader issue]. My research advances our understanding of this challenge by [specific contribution]. As a PhD candidate in [lab/program], I develop [methods/approaches] that help us [specific outcome]. Through partnerships with [collaborators], I've demonstrated how [specific finding/tool] can [practical impact]. My work has been supported by [grants/fellowships], enabling me to bridge [disciplines/approaches]. I complement my research through [teaching/community engagement], working to [broader mission]."

### Approach 4: Evolution-Based Narrative

The evolution-based narrative tells the story of how the research program has developed:

"My journey investigating [research area] began with [initial question/project], which revealed the critical need to understand [emerging challenge]. This insight led me to develop [approach/method], combining perspectives from [disciplines]. Working within [lab/group], I've built on these foundations to explore [current focus]. My contributions include [specific achievements], which have been recognized through [awards/presentations]. As I advance this work, I collaborate with [partners] to address [future challenges]. These experiences inform my commitment to [broader goal], which I pursue through [specific activities]."

### Approach Advantages

* Problem-Centered (Approach 1): Best for research with a clear practical challenge
* Methods-to-Impact (Approach 2): Ideal for technical or methodological innovations
* Impact-to-Methods (Approach 3): Strong for policy-relevant or socially-engaged research
* Evolution-Based (Approach 4): Effective for showing intellectual growth in applications

## Research Beat Templates

### Template 1: Emerging Topics

"I cover the rapidly evolving landscape of [phenomenon], where [established field] collides with [new development]. This has transformed from [historical state] to [current state], raising urgent questions about [key issues]. Using [methods], I investigate how [specific aspects] are reshaping [domain]. My sources range from [data source 1] to [data source 2], helping piece together the story of [research focus]. I've developed a network of [collaborators/informants] who help me understand where this story is heading next."

### Template 2: Intersectional Research

"My research sits at the crossroads of [field 1] and [field 2], where I track how [phenomenon] plays out in [context]. This intersection was largely unexplored until [catalyst/event], when researchers began noticing [pattern/trend]. I use [methods] to document and analyze [specific aspects], working particularly closely with [communities/stakeholders]. The story here isn't just about [surface issue], but about [deeper implications]. My research started from [early research] to [current investigations], and I intend to work in [future directions]."

### Template 3: Pattern Matching

"I investigate the patterns beneath [visible phenomenon], using [methods] to reveal how [underlying mechanisms] shape [outcomes]. This research emerged from a simple question: [foundational question]. While conventional wisdom suggested [assumption], my research has shown [new understanding]. Drawing on data from [source 1] to [source 2], I attempt to explain how [system/process] actually works. The implications touch everything from [application 1] to [application 2]."

### Template 4: Human-Centered

"My research examines how [people/communities/cultures] navigate and shape [domain/phenomenon] in [context]. Through [methodological approach], I investigate questions about [core human dynamics] that emerge as [stakeholders] encounter [changes/challenges]. Broadly, my research connects individual experiences of [specific aspect] to broader questions about [theoretical/social implications]. My work draws from [evidence types] to understand how [human practices] both reflect and transform [systems/structures]. Working closely with [communities/collaborators], I trace how [specific human element] influences and is influenced by [broader patterns/systems]."

### Template 5: Technical Systems

"My research investigates the underlying architecture of [system/phenomenon], examining how [components/processes] interact to shape [outcomes/behaviors]. Using [methodology], I analyze how [technical elements] function within [broader context]. My work hopes to reveal patterns in [data/processes] that help explain [system behavior/performance]. By developing [approaches/tools], I examine questions ranging from [specific technical focus] to [broader technical implications]. As my work continues to evolve, I'm especially interested in how [new developments] reshape our understanding of [technical domain]."
