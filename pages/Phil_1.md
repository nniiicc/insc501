# Major Philosophical Paradigms

| Paradigm | Epistemological Commitments | Ontological Stance | Impact on Computing Research | Major Thinkers |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Positivism | • Knowledge must be based on directly observable phenomena and empirical verification<br>• Scientific knowledge progresses through the discovery of universal laws<br>• Research must be conducted in a value-neutral way that eliminates subjective bias<br>• Truth claims must be testable and falsifiable | • Reality exists as a single, objective truth independent of observers<br>• The world consists of discrete, measurable entities with definable properties<br>• Causal relationships are deterministic and universal | • Formal methods and verification in software engineering<br>• Quantitative performance metrics and benchmarking<br>• Algorithm analysis and complexity theory | • Auguste Comte<br>• Ernst Mach<br>• Rudolf Carnap<br>• Carl Hempel |
| Post-positivism | • While objective reality exists, our understanding of it is inherently imperfect and probabilistic<br>• All observation is theory-laden and subject to researcher bias<br>• Knowledge claims must be subjected to critical examination<br>• Multiple methods and perspectives strengthen research validity | • Reality exists but can only be known imperfectly and probabilistically<br>• Natural laws exist but must be critically examined<br>• Context influences both reality and our perception of it | • Statistical approaches to machine learning<br>• Probabilistic algorithms and reasoning<br>• Empirical software engineering methods | • Karl Popper<br>• Thomas Kuhn<br>• Imre Lakatos<br>• Paul Feyerabend |
| Constructivism | • Knowledge is actively constructed through individual and social processes of meaning-making<br>• Understanding is shaped by prior experience and cultural context<br>• Truth is relative to the individual or community constructing it<br>• Research focuses on understanding multiple interpretations of reality | • Reality is socially constructed through shared meanings and interpretations<br>• Multiple realities exist simultaneously<br>• Truth is context-dependent and negotiated through social interaction | • Human-Computer Interaction design<br>• Participatory design methods<br>• Social computing and CSCW<br>• User experience research | • Jean Piaget<br>• Lev Vygotsky<br>• Ernst von Glasersfeld<br>• Peter Berger |
| Critical Theory | • Knowledge is inherently political and shaped by power relations<br>• Research should aim for emancipation and social transformation<br>• Theory and practice must be integrated for meaningful change<br>• Reflexivity and critique are essential to understanding power structures | • Reality is shaped by social, political, and economic values crystallized over time<br>• Historical forces structure human experience and knowledge<br>• Power relations are embedded in all aspects of reality | • Ethics and bias in AI systems<br>• Digital divide research<br>• Critical algorithm studies<br>• Technology impact assessment | • Max Horkheimer<br>• Jürgen Habermas<br>• Herbert Marcuse<br>• Nancy Fraser |
| Hermeneutics | • Understanding requires an interpretive process that acknowledges historical and cultural context<br>• Knowledge emerges through a 'hermeneutic circle' where understanding moves between parts and whole<br>• All understanding involves pre-understanding and tradition<br>• Interpretation is always situated and involves fusion of horizons | • Meaning and reality are inherently interpretive and linguistic<br>• Understanding is always mediated through language and tradition<br>• Reality is accessed through texts and symbolic systems<br>• Truth emerges through dialogue between interpreter and text | • Interface design and interpretation<br>• Information architecture<br>• Digital humanities methods<br>• Semantic web approaches | • Hans-Georg Gadamer<br>• Paul Ricoeur<br>• Martin Heidegger<br>• Wilhelm Dilthey |
