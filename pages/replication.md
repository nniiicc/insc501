There are a variety of different ways that researchers account for the validity of their research claims. Typically these are considered to be external or internal to a study design. 
The replication crisis in science is a shorthand way of describing the failure of empirical work to stand up to tests designed for internal or external validity. 
Replicaiton is an inexact phrase though - there are variety of different tests for validity that we might design based on differences in data, analysis, generalizability, etc. 

| Validation Approach | Primary Goal | Data Used | Methods | Key Characteristics | Validates |
|-----------|--------------|------------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Replication | Verify original findings | New data | Identical to original | - Same experimental conditions<br>- Same protocols<br>- Same measurements<br>- Different researchers | Direct repeatability of results |
| Reanalysis | Verify analytical accuracy | Original data | May vary | - Uses original raw data<br>- May apply new statistical approaches<br>- Checks computational steps<br>- Can use different software/tools | Computational and analytical validity |
| Reproduction | Test result generalizability | New data | Similar to original | - Independent data collection<br>- Follows original methods closely<br>- May have minor variations<br>- Different researchers | Robustness of findings across contexts |
| Verification | Check technical correctness | Original materials | Identical | - Reviews original code/materials<br>- Confirms calculations<br>- Examines procedures<br>- Documents any errors | Technical accuracy and documentation |
| Sensitivity | Test result robustness | Original or new data | Varied intentionally | - Changes parameters<br>- Tests different assumptions<br>- Modifies analysis methods<br>- Explores edge cases | Stability of results under different conditions |
| Extension | Expand understanding | New data | Modified/Enhanced | - Adds new variables<br>- Tests new conditions<br>- Explores related questions<br>- Applies to new contexts | Broader applicability and generalization |
