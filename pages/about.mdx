**Course description (from the iSchool):** 

Information Science is an interdisciplinary field of study that brings together scholars and scientists from a range of domains and fields of expertise.  The theoretical foundation of Information Science is as multifaceted as the backgrounds of the actors in the field.  For students of information science and information professionals to be able to navigate in the field it is important that they have a clear and solid understanding and appreciation for the theoretical foundation of and traditions in Information Science.  The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to the multiple approaches that are taken in Information Science and the study of information.

Upon satisfactory completion of this course the students will have demonstrated: 
- Knowledge of...
    - the multi-disciplinary context of Information Science
    - the range and nature of the influence of cognate disciplines 
- Understanding and appreciation of... 
    - the role in scholarship of theory, explanation, interpretation, and method
    - theories and models of information and information-related phenomena developed from various perspectives 
- Skills in the clarification, critical analysis, and evaluation of rival epistemological accounts of Information Science and information

**Here is my take on INSC 501:** 

INSC 570 introduces you to the literature on data collection and analysis methods commonly used in Information Science departments. I think of this as learning the software of Information Scienceâ€”practical, user-friendly, and reliable research programs.

INSC 501 introduces you to the dominant philosophies (epistemology and ontology) that shape research in Information Science. I think of this course as an introduction to the operating system of Information Science research, providing "foundational" tools to connect the real world (hardware) to the methods (software) used to produce new knowledge.

To extend this metaphor a bit further... in computing, an operating system (OS) functions as an "abstraction layer," simplifying the complexity of underlying hardware so software developers can write code without concerning themselves with specific hardware details. Similarly, INSC 501 will help you develop an operating system that abstracts away complex concepts like "truth" and "evidence," enabling effective research using appropriate methods. To achieve this, we focus on three key areas:

1. Historical Context - We examine Information Science's development through economic, technological, and political lenses. Rather than being comprehensive, we identify key historical anchors that help us understand our current position in the field.

2. Philosophical Foundations - We survey the fundamental commitments researchers make, including: What can be known? How we can best know something? What is knowledge?  While these concepts might seem abstract, our goal is to develop efficient ways to apply these abstractions in our future work.

3. Theories, Frameworks, and Models - We study major conceptual works from the past century that help researchers connect their findings to broader societal issues, such as: Identity; Privacy; and, Human flourishing. Again, our aim is not to get lost in theoretical concepts but to learn how to effectively use theory to contextualize our research.
